"Great scott!" he exclaimed in utter disbelief. "<break time="0.3s"/> A penguin? Among these trees? <break time="0.4s"/> And it appears to be attempting some sort of... aerial navigation!"

"Impossible!" he whispered in amazement. "<break time="0.3s"/> A penguin, this far from the coast? <break time="0.2s"/> How is the mad bastard generating... lift!?"


[Start Game Voicelines]

"Ah..." he murmured thoughtfully. "<break time="0.3s"/> What a remarkable specimen! A penguin attempting aerial maneuvers."

"Well well!" he said with a warm chuckle. "<break time="0.5s"/> Our flightless friend appears to have ambitions."

"Is that... <break time="0.4s"/> yes, a penguin practicing vertical locomotion!" he whispered excitedly."


[Loose Life Voicelines]

"Ahh! A slight miscalculation in trajectory."

"Not to worry," he said reassuringly. "<break time="0.2s"/> Even the Emperor Penguin stumbles occasionally."

"Oh dear..."
"Goodness!"
"Ouch... <break time="0.2s"/> That looked rather unfortunate."
"Oh! <break time="0.1s"/> Not quite the landing we hoped for."
"Oof <break time="0.2s"/> Bit of a rough patch there."
"My word!"
"Ah... <break time="0.2s"/> Perhaps we should make a note to avoid that particular obstacle."
"Oh no no no..."
"Oh dear <break time="0.2s"/> Do watch out for that rather nasty ice formation."
"A slight miscalculation in trajectory. <break time="0.3s"/> Let's make a note of that."
"Not to worry. <break time="0.2s"/> Even the Emperor Penguin stumbles occasionally."
"Goodness! <break time="0.2s"/> A rather unfortunate collision."


[End Game Voicelines]

"Well," he sighed wistfully, "<break time="0.4s"/> I suppose that concludes today's field observations. Perhaps we shall attempt this curious experiment again tomorrow?"
